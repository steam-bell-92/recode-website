# Introduction to Docker
</div>

Welcome! Docker helps you package and run applications in containers—think of them as lightweight, portable boxes that contain everything your app needs to run.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that lets you build, ship, and run applications inside containers. Instead of worrying about "it works on my machine" problems, Docker ensures your app runs the same way everywhere.

**Simple analogy:** Just like shipping containers standardized global trade, Docker containers standardize software deployment. Your application + its dependencies = one portable package.

## Why Use Docker?

- **Consistency** - Same behavior on your laptop, your teammate's computer, and production servers
- **Fast setup** - New developers can start working in minutes instead of days
- **Isolation** - Each app runs in its own environment without conflicts
- **Efficiency** - Containers are lightweight and start in seconds
- **Portability** - Build once, run anywhere

## Core Concepts

### Image
A blueprint for your application. Contains your code, runtime, libraries, and configuration. Images are built from a **Dockerfile** and never change once created.

### Container
A running instance of an image. Lightweight, isolated, and disposable. You can run multiple containers from the same image.

### Dockerfile
A simple text file with instructions to build an image:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

### Registry
A storage service for Docker images. **Docker Hub** is the most popular—like GitHub for Docker images.

### Volumes
Persistent storage that survives when containers are deleted. Essential for databases, logs, and user-generated content.

#### Types of Volumes:
1. **Named Volumes**: Managed by Docker. Best for persistent data like databases.
   ```bash
   # Create a volume
   docker volume create pg_data
   # Run container with named volume
   docker run -d -v pg_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres
   ```
2. **Bind Mounts**: Maps a host path to a container path. Best for development.
   ```bash
   # Mount current directory to /app
   docker run -d -v $(pwd):/app node:18-alpine
   ```
3. **Tmpfs Mounts**: Stored in host memory (RAM). Best for sensitive or temporary data.
   ```bash
   docker run -d --tmpfs /app/cache my-app
   ```

### Networks
Allows containers to communicate with each other securely.

#### Network Drivers & Use Cases:
1. **Bridge (Default)**: Best for standalone containers that need to talk to each other on the same host.
   - **Use Case**: Connecting a frontend container to a backend container.
   ```bash
   docker network create my-net
   docker run -d --net my-net --name db mysql
   docker run -d --net my-net --name app my-app
   ```
2. **Host**: Removes isolation between host and container (shares host IP).
   - **Use Case**: High-performance apps where network overhead must be minimal.
   ```bash
   docker run -d --network host nginx
   ```
3. **Overlay**: Connects multiple Docker daemons together.
   - **Use Case**: Microservices spread across multiple physical servers (Docker Swarm).
4. **None**: Disables all networking.
   - **Use Case**: Secure batch processing jobs with no external access needed.
   ```bash
   docker run -d --network none alpine
   ```

## Quick Start Workflow

**1. Create a Dockerfile**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**2. Build your image**
```bash
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .
```

**3. Run a container**
```bash
docker run -d --name my-app -p 8000:8000 my-app:1.0
```

**4. Check it's running**
```bash
docker ps
docker logs my-app
```

That's it! Your app is now running in a container.

## Next Steps

1. **Install Docker** - Get Docker Desktop (Mac/Windows) or Docker Engine (Linux)
2. **Learn Docker Commands** - Master essential CLI commands
3. **Create Dockerfiles** - Build custom images
4. **Try Docker Compose** - Manage multi-container apps
5. **Explore Docker Hub** - Find pre-built images

## Key Takeaways

- **Containers** package your app with everything it needs
- **Images** are blueprints, containers are running instances
- **Dockerfiles** define how to build images
- **Docker Compose** manages multiple containers together
- Docker makes development, testing, and deployment much easier

## What Can You Do with Docker?

- **Web Development** - Containerize Node.js, Python, PHP applications
- **Microservices** - Build and deploy scalable service architectures  
- **Development Environment** - Consistent dev setups across teams
- **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automated testing and deployment
- **Database Management** - Run isolated database instances
- **Cloud Deployment** - Deploy anywhere with container orchestration

### Docker vs Virtual Machines

| Feature | Docker Containers | Virtual Machines |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Resource Usage** | Lightweight, shares OS kernel | Heavy, full OS per VM |
| **Startup Time** | Seconds | Minutes |
| **Isolation** | Process-level | Hardware-level |
| **Portability** | High | Medium |
| **Performance** | Near-native | Overhead from hypervisor |

### Good to Know

1. Docker containers share the host OS kernel, making them much more efficient than VMs
2. Container images are built in layers, enabling efficient storage and transfer
3. You can run multiple containers from the same image
4. Containers are **stateless** by default - use volumes for persistent data
5. Docker works on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**

### Why is Docker so Popular?

Docker has revolutionized software development and deployment because:

* **"It Works on My Machine" Problem Solved**
  Docker ensures your application runs the same way everywhere, eliminating environment-related bugs.

* **Faster Development Cycles**
  Developers can quickly spin up consistent environments without complex setup procedures.

* **Efficient Resource Utilization**
  Containers use fewer resources than virtual machines while providing similar isolation benefits.

* **Simplified Deployment**
  Package your application with all dependencies into a single, portable container image.

* **Scalability**
  Easily scale applications up or down by running multiple container instances.

* **DevOps Integration**
  Perfect fit for CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated testing and deployment workflows.
