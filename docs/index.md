## What is recode hive?

recode hive is a community-first platform that focuses on:

- **Data Science & Engineering** — tutorials, projects, and guides on Python, SQL, Pandas, and data pipelines.
- **Open Source Contribution** — a welcoming space to make your first (or hundredth) pull request.
- **GitHub & Developer Tools** — hands-on learning for Git, GitHub Actions, Copilot, and the GitHub ecosystem.
- **Career Growth** — blog posts, podcasts, and resources tailored to help developers and data professionals grow their careers.

The platform is built with [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), written in TypeScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS. Every piece of content — docs, blogs, community pages — is open-source and open to contributions.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) *(optional — for containerized development)*

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recode-website.git
cd recode-website

Add the upstream remote so you can stay in sync with the main repo:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/recodehive/recode-website.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The site hot-reloads automatically as you edit files.

### 4. Using Docker (Alternative)

```bash
# Build the image (first time only)
docker build -t recodehive-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 recodehive-app

Or with hot-reload using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
